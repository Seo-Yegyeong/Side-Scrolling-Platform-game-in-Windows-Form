# C# Tutorial Create a side scrolling platform game in visual studio
Welcome to this new tutorial from MOO ICT, I am very excited to show you my new project and this one was quiet an accomplishment from my point of view, because it took me forever to figure it out all the while trying to keep the core concept as simple as possible for beginner programmers. In this project we will make a side scrolling platform game similar to mario and sonic but not to those legendary scales. 

In this project you will learn how to make a simple side scrolling game using windows and C# programming only using Visual Studio and the system default components. 

We will make this game using picture boxes, label and timer. We will make out functions inside the C# and make the level move left and right with the character. 

To demonstrate this method, this game requires the player to go the end of the level to collect and key and then come back to the beginning of the level and open a door to complete the game, during the game play you can jump on platforms, collect various coins. There are also pitfalls, if you fall off the platforms then you will end the game, luckily we will code a game restart function inside of it too so when that happens you can start the game again and try to complete it. 

I hope this small project comes handy for your own, happy programming and moo out.
